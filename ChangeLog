	* configure.in: bumped to 0.1.1

	* lexer.ll: changed lexer to accept more forms of leaf-labels.

	* set-matcher-test.cc: updated tests...I forgot to do this when I
	changed the output of un-supported branches.

	* sdist.cc (main): catches label-mismatch exceptions so we report
	it as faulty output rather than just crash.
