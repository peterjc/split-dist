Split-Dist is a tool for calculating the split-distance between binary
trees (i.e. the number of splits present in the one tree but not the
other).

The split-dist program reads in a set of trees in Newick format and
calculates which of the edges/splits are shared between them.  The
result is given in the form of a matrix, where entry i,j gives the
number of edges in tree i that are also found in tree j.

 Statistics about the splits _not_ shared between two trees can also
 be calculate.  This is done by considering, for each non-trivial
 split---splits with more than a leaf element on both sides of the
 edge---the size of the smallest of the two sets in the split A|B.
 The maximal, minimal and averge size of the smallest set in the
 splits not shared are calculated and reported.  This statistics gives
 an indication of how "local" the differences are between the two
 trees&mdash;if the smallest set is small, the edge that differs gives
 a difference in a small sub-tree, if the set is larger, the
 difference is more global.  To get the split-statistics use option
 --print-split-statistics.


The tool can also calculate the set of splits found in any tree (with
a cound of how often the split is found) and the set of splits shared
by all trees in the set.  This information is printed if the program
is called with the options --print-all-splits or --print-shared-splits

Information about which splits in one tree are also found in the other
trees can be reported in an annotated tree.  This tree, output in
Newick format, has the same topology as the first tree, but the edges
are written as 

  sub-tree f : branch-length,

where f is the fraction of the trees that contains the edge, i.e., 1
if the edge is supported by all trees or 0.5 if only half the trees
contains the edge.

If, for example, we run <tt>sdist tree1.tre tree2.tre, where
tree1.tre is:

(
  ('Chimp':0.052625,
   'Human':0.042375):0.007875,
  'Gorilla':0.060125,
  ('Gibbon':0.124833,
   'Orangutan':0.0971667):0.038875
);


and tree2.tre is:

(
  'Chimp':0.052625,
  ('Human':0.042375,
   'Gorilla':0.060125):0.007875,
  ('Gibbon':0.124833,
   'Orangutan':0.0971667):0.038875
);

sdist, with options --verbose --print-all-splits --print-trees will report

Distance matrix:
tree1.tre :   -   1
tree2.tre :   1   -
 
1 out of 3 non-trivial splits shared by all trees.
 
All splits:
Human Chimp | Orangutan Gibbon Gorilla  : 1
Gorilla Human | Orangutan Gibbon Chimp  : 1
Gorilla Human Chimp | Orangutan Gibbon  : 2
 
tree1.tre : 
  (
   ('Orangutan' 1 : 0.0971667, 
    'Gibbon' 1 : 0.124833) 1 : 0.038875,
   'Gorilla' 1 : 0.060125, 
   ('Human' 1 : 0.042375, 
    'Chimp' 1 : 0.052625) 0.5 : 0.007875
  )
tree2.tre : 
  (
   ('Orangutan' 1 : 0.0971667,
    'Gibbon' 1 : 0.124833) 1 : 0.038875,
   ('Gorilla' 1 : 0.060125, 
    'Human' 1 : 0.042375) 0.5 : 0.007875,
   'Chimp' 1 : 0.052625
  )

Only non-trivial splits are reported as the the trivial splits are
shared by all trees.

Run sdist --help for more info.
